# Getting Started with gRPC 


# Use Case 

- Online retail scenario has a `` ProductInfo`` microservice which is responsible for managing the produts and their information. The consumer of that service can add, remove, retrive products via that service. 

- ``ProductInfo`` service is implemented on `` Go``. 
- One of the consumer of that service is written using ``Java``. 
- This use case shows you can implement both ``ProductInfo`` service and its consumer.
